The PROactive cohort study identifies children with a chronic disease at high risk of debilitating fatigue, decreased daily life participation and psychosocial problems, as well as children who are resilient and thrive despite the challenges of growing up with a chronic condition. Both groups will teach us how we can best support children, adolescents and parents to adapt to and manage a disease, as well as tailor interventions to their specific needs. 
This cohort follows a continuous longitudinal design. It is based at the Wilhelmina Childrenâ€™s Hospital (WKZ) in the Netherlands and has been running since December 2016.

This GitHub repository contains R scripts and documentation for carrying out periodic 'data locks' at the cross-sectional and longitudinal level. It also contains scripts for cleaning up data pertaining to informed consent.
